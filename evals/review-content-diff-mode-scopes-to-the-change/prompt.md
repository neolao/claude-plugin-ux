Invoke the `ux:review-content` sub-agent (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "ux:review-content"`) to review the change described by `fixtures/change.diff` in this case directory. Give it exactly this prompt:

```
mode: diff
diff: fixtures/change.diff (files are the post-change versions under fixtures/)
exclusions: none
specs: fixtures/.ux/product.md, fixtures/.ux/inventory.md (no .ux/style.md, no .ux/screens/*.md)
```

Once the sub-agent returns, report its findings back verbatim.
